# Module 1 Refactor Challenge

## Description 

This page was a test of using semantic html and also condensing code to be more succinct and easier to read. This involved a number of changes to both the html and css in the starter code and was the first task of the bootcamp. I learned about a number of different html tags that I didn't know about and grew a greater understanding of css. This is not a page I created but I refactored the code. Thank you for checking it out!
